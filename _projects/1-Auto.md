### Project Overview
For my MAE 4861 Senior Design Project, I completed a full engineering redesign of a production vehicle to significantly improve **engine performance**, **suspension behavior**, and **transmission characteristics** under realistic market and cost constraints. The goal was to create a competitive performance package suitable for a target location while maintaining affordability and compatibility with an existing 1.798 L inline-four platform.

The final design delivered:
- **Power increase from 148 hp → 210–249 hp** depending on turbo configuration  
- **Suspension roll-angle reduction** from 7.36° → 6.71°, and <1° with anti-roll bars  
- **Optimized gear ratios** for both 5-speed and 6-speed transmissions  
- Improved drivability, handling, and efficiency across the full operating envelope  

This project integrated coursework knowledge from thermodynamics, system dynamics, heat transfer, vehicle structures, and drivetrain design into a cohesive, data-driven engineering package.

### Engine Performance Upgrade: Turbocharger & Intercooler Design
I performed a complete thermodynamic and compressor-map analysis to select a turbocharger capable of meeting the vehicle’s airflow and boost requirements.

**Turbocharger Selected:** Garrett GBC22-350 (44 mm)  
**Boost Pressure:** +83.0 kPa  
**Isentropic Efficiency Used:** 72%  
**Volumetric Efficiency:** 91%  

Two configurations were evaluated:

#### **Option 1 – Turbocharger Only**
- Pressure ratio: **1.82**  
- Post-compressor temperature: **375 K**  
- Boosted air density: **1.71 kg/m³**  
- **Peak power:** ~**210 hp** (+42.4%)

#### **Option 2 – Turbocharger + Intercooler**
- Intercooler effectiveness: **70%**  
- Post-IC temperature: **317 K**  
- Boosted air density: **2.03 kg/m³**  
- **Peak power:** ~**249 hp** (+68.8%)  
- Heat rejection: **10.4 kW**

The intercooled configuration provides the highest performance margin and best thermal control, while the non-intercooled option offers strong gains at lower cost.

### Suspension Redesign for Improved Handling
Using roll-center theory, camber geometry, and load transfer modeling, I evaluated the base suspension and developed an improved A-arm layout.

#### **Baseline Suspension Results**
- Roll angle during 0.650 g turn: **7.36°**  
- Camber angles: equal magnitude for inside and outside wheels, **±7.36°**

#### **Improved Suspension Geometry**
By relocating A-arm mounting points and modifying link lengths, the redesigned suspension achieved:
- Roll angle: **6.71°** (no anti-roll bars)  
- Camber angle: nearly neutral (inside: ~0.00°, outside: ~0.01°)  

To achieve less than **1.00°** roll during a 0.650 g turn, a pair of anti-roll bars was sized:
- Total added stiffness: **103,011 N·m/rad**  
- Stiffness per bar: **51.5 kN·m/rad**

These improvements provide significantly better handling, higher cornering capability, and better tire loading.

### Transmission Optimization: 5-Speed and 6-Speed Gearboxes
I optimized gear ratios using traction limits, top-speed requirements, and progressive gear-step formulas. The goal was to align engine peak power speed with achievable vehicle speed curves.

#### **5-Speed Gearbox**
- 1st gear selected using maximum tractive effort  
- 4th gear tuned to match top speed at peak power  
- Remaining gears solved using progressive ratio steps  

**Final Ratios:**  
1st: 3.61  
2nd: 2.16  
3rd: 1.43  
4th: 1.04  
5th: 0.831  

#### **6-Speed Gearbox**
- 1st and 5th based on traction and top-speed constraints  
- Middle gears generated by progressive ratio stepping

**Final Ratios:**  
1st: 3.61  
2nd: 2.47  
3rd: 1.77  
4th: 1.32  
5th: 1.04  
6th: 0.861  

A special case was solved for **front-wheel drive**, yielding an ideal 1st-gear ratio of **3.90**.

### My Contribution
This project was completed individually, and I was responsible for:

- **Performing all thermodynamic, fluid-dynamic, and compressor-map analyses** for turbocharger selection  
- **Modeling intercooler performance using heat-transfer principles**  
- **Deriving suspension roll and camber behavior** using system dynamics, geometry, and load-transfer calculations  
- **Redesigning A-arms and specifying anti-roll bar stiffnesses**  
- **Optimizing gear ratios** using traction limits, top-speed modeling, and progressive gearing formulas  
- **Generating all MATLAB and spreadsheet calculations**, figures, and plots  
- **Authoring the complete technical engineering report**  

This project required application of physics-based modeling, numerical analysis, and multi-domain engineering reasoning.

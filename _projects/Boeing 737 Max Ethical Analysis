### Overview

For my MAE 4300 coursework, I completed a comprehensive ethical analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. This project examines how technical design decisions, organizational pressures, certification processes, and sociotechnical interactions contributed to the failures that led to the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashes. Through a structured ethics framework, I evaluated the relevant facts, stakeholders, ASME ethical canons, and constraints that shaped the incident and identified lessons for avoiding ethical failures in future aerospace systems.

### 1. Ethical Issues in the 737 MAX Incident
This section analyzes the central ethical problems that shaped the crisis and why they were significant.

Major Ethical Issues
- Concealment of the MCAS system: Boeing intentionally minimized MCAS’s importance and did not fully disclose its behavior to airlines or pilots. This eliminated pilot preparedness and undermined informed operational safety.
- Insufficient pilot training: Boeing pushed to avoid simulator training to preserve cost competitiveness. This created a knowledge gap that became critical during MCAS activation.
- Organizational pressure and schedule-driven engineering: Pressure to compete with Airbus’ A320neo accelerated development timelines and encouraged unsafe compromises.
- Regulatory capture during certification: The FAA delegated many certification tasks to Boeing engineers, creating a conflict of interest that enabled inadequate oversight.
- Failure to communicate known risks: After internal simulations indicated catastrophic outcomes under certain MCAS activations, Boeing did not issue prompt corrections or advisories.

These issues directly influenced:
- Pilot situational awareness
- System redundancy and failure tolerance
- Aircraft certification reliability
- Public trust in aviation safety
- The loss of lives

### 2. Material Facts, Individual Facts, and Organizational Facts
Material (Technical) Facts
- MCAS relied on a single angle-of-attack sensor despite operating as a flight-critical system.
- The system could activate repeatedly and apply large downward stabilizer inputs.
- Boeing modeled MCAS as a “minor” system change to avoid triggering higher scrutiny by the FAA.
- Pilot documentation omitted any mention of MCAS.

Individual Facts
- Some engineers expressed concerns about MCAS aggressiveness and lack of redundancy.
- Whistleblowers later stated they feared retaliation for speaking up.
- Key individuals approved decisions based on schedule and cost constraints rather than safety margins.

Organizational Facts
- Boeing prioritized rapid market response over iterative safety validation.
- The FAA increasingly relied on Boeing employees for certification (“Organization Designation Authorization”).
- Internal cultural norms emphasized meeting deadlines and avoiding delays.

### 3. Missing Relevant Facts & Assumptions
Throughout the analysis, several important facts were either unavailable or assumed:

Missing Facts
- The full internal communication chain explaining why MCAS redundancy was rejected.
- Transparency around Boeing’s risk-assessment methodology during redesign.
- Exact discussions between FAA and Boeing during certification of flight-control logic.

Assumptions Made
- Boeing engineers understood the catastrophic potential of MCAS failure.
- The FAA lacked sufficient technical resources to independently verify software decisions.
- Pilots received no meaningful MCAS-specific training before aircraft entry into service.

These assumptions were necessary to complete the ethical evaluation based on available evidence.

### 4. Stakeholders Affected
A stakeholder map was created earlier in the course; the major groups include:
- Passengers and their families: Primary victims of the failures and those who bore the ultimate risk.
- Pilots and flight crews: Responsible for operating an aircraft without complete system knowledge.
- Boeing engineers & employees: Impacted by corporate decisions and ethical culture constraints.
- Airlines: Faced financial losses and operational disruptions.
- The FAA and global regulators: Lost institutional trust and faced scrutiny for oversight breakdowns.
- Competing aerospace manufacturers: Indirectly affected by changes to certification and regulatory processes.
- The general public: Trust in aviation safety was significantly eroded.

### 5. Relevant ASME Ethical Canons
Several ASME Canons were clearly violated or compromised:
- Canon 1: Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.
Boeing’s decision to conceal MCAS behavior and minimize training contradicted this fundamental obligation.
- Canon 3: Avoid deceptive acts.
Downplaying MCAS in documentation and certification misled both operators and regulators.
- Canon 5: Accept responsibility for your actions.
Boeing’s initial lack of accountability after the first crash violated this requirement.
- Canon 6: Continue professional development and support the professional development of others.
Pilots were not given the training necessary for safe operation.

### 6. Critical Facts & Resolution of Issues
After identifying critical facts, several resolution pathways were evaluated:

Critical Facts
- MCAS was fundamentally unsafe with a single point of failure.
- Pilots were not equipped with the information or training needed to counter MCAS activation.
- FAA oversight was insufficient and structurally compromised.
- Boeing’s organizational culture discouraged raising safety concerns.

Resolution Strategies
- Full redesign of MCAS with sensor redundancy and limited authority.
- Mandatory simulator training for all MAX pilots.
- Structural FAA reform to reduce reliance on delegated certification.
- Transparency requirements for flight-critical system changes.
- Organizational shifts at Boeing to reinforce safety culture over market timeline pressures.

### 7. Identifying Constraints & Avoiding Ethical Problems
During the analysis, several key constraints were identified:

Engineering Constraints
- Aircraft needed to match A320neo performance without fully redesigning the airframe.
- Limited timeframes pressured design shortcuts.

Organizational Constraints
- Cultural norms prioritized cost-saving and speed.
- Incentive structures discouraged transparency.

Regulatory Constraints
- The FAA lacked staffing and expertise to independently verify all software systems.
- Delegated authority created conflict-of-interest risks.

How These Problems Could Have Been Avoided
- Early adoption of redundant sensor logic for MCAS.
- Clear, honest communication to airlines and pilots.
- A certification process that treats all flight-control software with highest scrutiny.
- An internal culture rewarding safety concerns instead of penalizing them.

### 8. Lessons Learned
This case demonstrates that:
- Engineering failures are rarely purely technical—they are sociotechnical.
- Transparency and documentation are essential for safety.
- Engineers must be empowered to speak up.
- Ethical decision-making is not optional—it is a core engineering responsibility.

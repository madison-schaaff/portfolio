### Project Overview
As part of MAE 4272, our team was tasked with designing a custom wind-turbine blade capable of outperforming the baseline blade from Lab 4. The goal was to produce a geometry that delivered higher power output at low Reynolds numbers while remaining structurally reliable and compatible with the existing hub and test hardware. This project combined aerodynamic modeling, CAD development, and wind-tunnel validation (see **Figure 3** for the experimental setup).

### Design Process
We began by selecting design conditions of 5 m/s wind speed and a target operating speed near 1880 RPM. Using Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) and airfoil performance data, we iterated on blade twist, taper, and chord distribution to maintain an efficient angle of attack across the span.  
**My primary contribution was creating the full CAD model of the system**, including the custom airfoil, blade geometry, and hub interface. The final manufacturable design is shown in **Figure 1**, which highlights the aerodynamic taper and root attachment features used during testing.

### Testing Summary
We tested the finished blade in the MAE wind tunnel using a torque brake and DAQ system to measure torque, RPM, and electrical power. During testing, **I operated the torque brake by adjusting the voltage to sweep through the operating range and recorded corresponding data for power-curve generation**. The resulting power curve, shown in **Figure 2**, demonstrates that our custom blade achieved a higher peak power than the Lab 4 baseline.

### My Contribution
Across the project, I was responsible for:
- **All CAD development**, including airfoil construction, blade geometry, and hub/attachment modeling  
- Preparing manufacturing-ready files and verifying geometric and structural constraints  
- **Operating the torque brake** during wind-tunnel tests and recording experimental data  
- Organizing raw data for power-curve generation and comparison with BEMT predictions

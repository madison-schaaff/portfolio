For our MAE 2250 project, our team designed, modeled, and prototyped a Cord Cubby: a compact and user-friendly device aimed at solving the common problem of tangled and disorganized cords. The Cord Cubby is designed to neatly spool various types of cords such as phone chargers, earphones, and USB cables into a clean and secure enclosure, making storage and transport easier and more aesthetic.

### Design & Functionality

The Cord Cubby features:

- A cylindrical spool mechanism that allows users to easily wind their cords by rotating an external knob.  
- An ergonomic outer casing that is smooth and rounded for safe handling, with slots that guide the cord into place during retraction.  
- Snap-fit or magnetic housing to allow easy access to the internal spool when needed for cleaning or adjustment.  
- A transparent window so the user can see the remaining length of cord inside.  
- Optional spring tension or clutch system to control the cord winding speed and prevent tangling.  

### CAD & Prototyping

Using CAD software (Fusion 360), we created detailed 3D models of each component, paying close attention to tolerance, material selection, and assembly constraints. The render you see shows an exploded view of the Cord Cubby, highlighting how the internal components fit together. The main components include:

- A spool for the cord to wrap around  
- A rotating dial or knob for manual retraction  
- The two-part outer casing that houses the mechanism  

We later fabricated the prototype using a combination of 3D printing and off-the-shelf hardware for the internal mechanics. Our testing confirmed that the Cord Cubby is effective at reducing clutter and extending the lifespan of cords by minimizing kinks and knots.

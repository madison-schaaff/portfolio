### Project Overview
For this individual project in heat transfer and finite element analysis, I performed a full ANSYS simulation of an LED heat sink to evaluate whether the design could maintain safe operating temperatures. The assignment focused on understanding **boundary conditions, mesh convergence, heat flux behavior, and thermal design modifications**.

The analysis included:
- Building and refining the mesh  
- Applying convection and insulation boundary conditions  
- Verifying energy conservation  
- Evaluating heat flux and temperature gradients  
- Testing a modified heat sink geometry and comparing thermal performance  

This project strengthened my understanding of finite element heat transfer, numerical sensitivity, and the thermal design tradeoffs present in compact electronic systems.

### Pre-Analysis & Boundary Condition Setup
Before building the ANSYS model, I evaluated the correctness of several theoretical statements related to the governing physics and FEA implementation.

Key findings:
- **Insulated boundaries must use the normal derivative \( dT/dn \)**, not directional derivatives (e.g., \( dT/dy \)).  
- The **finite element solver computes temperatures at nodes**, not at elements.  
- Polynomial interpolation within each element constructs the global system of algebraic equations.  
- Post-processing relies on nodal temperatures to compute quantities such as heat flux vectors, temperature contours, and energy balances.

This pre-analysis provided the physical and mathematical foundation for correctly setting up the ANSYS model.

### Solution 1: Baseline Heat Sink Design
For the baseline geometry, I simulated steady-state heat conduction with convection at the fin surfaces and internal heat generation at the LED.

#### **Temperature Distribution**
- Maximum temperature: **81.53°C**  
- Well below the design requirement of **85°C**  
- Temperature decreases smoothly from the LED through the fin array, as expected due to conduction paths and convection cooling

#### **Heat Flux Distribution**
Heat flux radiated outward from the LED and then followed the fin geometry as heat transferred toward the convection surfaces.

- Highest heat flux occurred near the LED center  
- Flux magnitude decreased toward fin tips  
- Shape of flux field confirmed correct physics and mesh resolution near gradients

#### **Energy Conservation Check**
- Heat generated: **24.43 W**  
- Heat lost to convection: **24.42 W**  
- Difference: **0.01 W**, indicating **excellent numerical energy balance**

#### **Mesh Convergence Behavior**
- Temperature changed minimally when refining the mesh (81.53°C → 81.60°C)  
- Heat flux changed substantially (92,029 W/m² → 130,700 W/m²)

This confirmed an important FEA principle:  
> **Gradients such as heat flux are far more mesh-sensitive than scalar temperature fields.**

### Solution 2: Modified Heat Sink Geometry
To test how geometry impacts cooling performance, I reduced the fin length from **0.10 m → 0.06 m** and re-ran the analysis.

#### **Temperature Distribution**
- Maximum temperature: **94.99°C**  
- Exceeded the design requirement of 85°C  
- Demonstrated clear thermal performance degradation

#### **Why the Modified Design Failed**
- Shorter fins reduced the available **surface area for convection**, lowering the heat sink’s ability to reject thermal energy  
- Heat had less distance along the fin to dissipate, resulting in higher temperatures near the LED  
- Lower surface area → reduced convection → more stored heat → higher steady-state temperature

This comparison highlighted the critical importance of fin length and surface area when designing compact heat sinks.

### Key Engineering Takeaways
Through this analysis, I developed a deeper understanding of:

- **Boundary condition formulation** for convection and insulation  
- **Mesh sensitivity**, especially for gradient-dependent quantities  
- **Energy conservation verification** in finite element models  
- **Thermal design principles** for heat sinks and compact electronics  
- How geometry influences temperature distribution and cooling performance  

The project also strengthened my ability to interpret FEA results and validate them against theoretical expectations.

### My Contribution
Since this was an **individual project**, I completed all aspects of the work, including:

- Defining the theoretical model and boundary conditions  
- Setting up the ANSYS geometry, materials, convection coefficients, and heat generation  
- Generating meshes and performing mesh refinement studies  
- Running simulations and extracting temperature and heat flux fields  
- Performing energy checks to ensure physical accuracy  
- Documenting thermal performance differences between baseline and modified designs

### Summary
The baseline heat sink successfully met the thermal design requirement, while the shortened-fin variant failed due to reduced surface area and ineffective convection. This ANSYS project demonstrated how modeling, physics-based reasoning, and geometric intuition work together in real-world thermal system design.

### Overview
For my MAE 4300 coursework, I completed a comprehensive ethical and engineering analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. This project examined how technical design choices, organizational pressures, certification processes, and sociotechnical interactions contributed to the failures that led to the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashes. Using a structured ethics framework, I evaluated material facts, stakeholder interests, ASME ethical canons, and the constraints that shaped Boeing’s decisions. The goal of this work was to identify root causes and extract lessons that can prevent similar failures in future aerospace systems.

### 1. Ethical Issues in the 737 MAX Incident
The 737 MAX crisis was shaped by a set of interconnected ethical failures involving engineering judgment, communication, and organizational decision-making.  

**Major Ethical Issues**
- **Concealment of the MCAS system:** Boeing intentionally downplayed MCAS and omitted it from pilot documentation, undermining informed operational safety.  
- **Insufficient pilot training:** Boeing sought to avoid simulator requirements to maintain cost competitiveness, creating a critical knowledge gap for pilots.  
- **Schedule-driven engineering pressure:** Competition with Airbus accelerated development timelines and encouraged unsafe compromises.  
- **Regulatory capture during certification:** The FAA delegated essential certification tasks to Boeing employees, creating conflicts of interest.  
- **Failure to communicate known risks:** Internal simulations and engineer concerns about MCAS failure modes were not acted on or communicated promptly.

These issues influenced:
- Pilot situational awareness and decision-making  
- System redundancy and fault tolerance  
- Certification credibility and oversight  
- Public trust in aviation safety  
- Ultimately, the loss of 346 lives

### 2. Material, Individual, and Organizational Facts
Understanding the crisis requires distinguishing technical facts from human and structural factors.

**Material (Technical) Facts**
- MCAS relied on a single angle-of-attack sensor despite controlling flight-critical behavior.  
- The system could repeatedly command nose-down trim with limited pilot authority to counteract it.  
- Boeing categorized MCAS as a “minor” design change to avoid higher certification scrutiny.  
- Pilot manuals and training materials omitted MCAS entirely.

**Individual Facts**
- Some engineers raised concerns about MCAS aggressiveness and lack of redundancy.  
- Whistleblowers later reported fear of retaliation for speaking up.  
- Key individuals approved design decisions under cost and schedule constraints.

**Organizational Facts**
- Boeing prioritized rapid market competition over iterative safety validation.  
- FAA reliance on Boeing’s internal certification (ODA) reduced independent oversight.  
- Cultural norms emphasized meeting deadlines and minimizing changes.

### 3. Missing Relevant Facts & Assumptions
Certain details were unavailable, requiring assumptions to complete the analysis.

**Missing Facts**
- Complete internal rationale for rejecting redundant sensor inputs.  
- Full transparency around Boeing’s risk-assessment methodology during redesign.  
- Records of FAA–Boeing discussions related to MCAS certification logic.

**Assumptions Made**
- Engineers understood the catastrophic potential of MCAS failure modes.  
- The FAA lacked resources to independently verify software behavior.  
- Pilots received no meaningful MCAS-specific training before service entry.

### 4. Stakeholders Affected
A broad stakeholder map reveals the sociotechnical impact of Boeing’s decisions.

- **Passengers and families:** Direct victims bearing ultimate safety risk.  
- **Pilots and flight crews:** Responsible for operating an aircraft without complete system knowledge.  
- **Boeing engineers and employees:** Constrained by organizational pressures and cultural norms.  
- **Airlines:** Experienced financial losses and operational disruptions.  
- **Regulators (FAA and global authorities):** Suffered loss of credibility and oversight trust.  
- **Competing manufacturers:** Impacted by changes to certification practices.  
- **General public:** Confidence in aviation safety declined significantly.

### 5. Relevant ASME Ethical Canons
Several ASME Canons were clearly violated or compromised:

- **Canon 1:** *Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.*  
  Boeing’s minimization of MCAS behavior directly contradicted this obligation.

- **Canon 3:** *Avoid deceptive acts.*  
  Downplaying MCAS in training materials and certification processes misled regulators and pilots.

- **Canon 5:** *Accept responsibility for your actions.*  
  Boeing’s initial response after the first crash did not acknowledge known design faults.

- **Canon 6:** *Continue professional development and support the development of others.*  
  Pilots were not given the training required for safe operation of a modified aircraft.

---

### 6. Critical Facts & Resolution Strategies
After evaluating material and ethical facts, several insights emerged.

**Critical Facts**
- MCAS introduced a flight-critical single point of failure.  
- Pilots were not provided adequate information or training to counter uncommanded inputs.  
- FAA oversight was weakened by structural reliance on Boeing engineers.  
- Boeing’s internal culture discouraged raising safety concerns.

**Resolution Strategies**
- Redesign MCAS with sensor redundancy and limited authority.  
- Require full simulator training for MAX pilots.  
- Strengthen FAA independence and reduce delegated certification.  
- Mandate transparency for all flight-critical system changes.  
- Shift organizational incentives toward long-term safety over short-term market pressure.

### 7. Constraints and How Ethical Problems Could Have Been Avoided
**Engineering Constraints**
- The aircraft needed to match A320neo performance without a clean-sheet redesign.  
- Compressed timelines created pressure for incremental rather than fundamental fixes.

**Organizational Constraints**
- Cost and schedule pressures dominated safety considerations.  
- Internal incentive structures discouraged transparency and dissent.

**Regulatory Constraints**
- FAA staffing and expertise limitations reduced software-system oversight.  
- Delegated authority increased conflict-of-interest risk.

**How These Issues Could Have Been Avoided**
- Early adoption of redundant sensor inputs and robust fail-safe logic.  
- Honest communication to pilots and airlines regarding MCAS.  
- Treating all flight-control modifications as safety-critical during certification.  
- Reinforcing a culture where raising safety concerns is valued and protected.

### 8. Lessons Learned
The 737 MAX crisis demonstrates that engineering failures are rarely purely technical—they emerge from the interaction of design, organizations, economics, and ethics. This case highlights that:

- Safety requires transparency and rigorous documentation.  
- Engineers must be empowered to speak up without fear of retaliation.  
- Ethical decision-making is foundational to engineering practice.  
- Sociotechnical awareness is essential when designing high-stakes aerospace systems.  

The analysis reinforced that ethical responsibility is not an optional supplement to engineering — it is a core professional requirement that directly influences public safety and trust.

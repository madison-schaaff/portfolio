## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is Madison Schaaff, and I am a fourth-year student at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace Engineering. My academic background has given me a strong foundation in the principles of dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and structural analysis. Beyond the classroom, I’m deeply passionate about advancing transportation technologies.

In addition to my interest in ground technology, I’m driven by the challenge of revolutionizing space structures and aerospace technology. I aspire to contribute to the design and development of next-generation spacecraft, deployable systems, and sustainable  infrastructure that can support long-term space exploration.

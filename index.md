## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is Madison Schaaff, I'm fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University and a candidate for the Cornell M.Eng. in Aerospace Engineering with a concentration in propulsion. Through coursework, research, and industry experience, I’ve developed a strong foundation in dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, structural analysis, aerospace engineering, and systems engineering.

My engineering interests center on aerospace, transportation, and high-performance engineered systems. I’m especially drawn to the intersection of design, manufacturing, and operations, where complex systems are optimized and brought into production. My roles with NASA L’SPACE, Procter & Gamble, Xylem, Cornell Hyperloop, SEA Lab, and the Space Systems Design Studio have reinforced this interest by giving me hands-on experience in modeling, testing, prototyping, and large-scale manufacturing environments.

Looking ahead, I’m driven by the challenge of advancing next-generation aerospace and space technologies. I hope to contribute to the development of aircraft systems, spacecraft, deployable structures, and long-duration space infrastructure. My long-term goal is to work at the interface of aerospace design and manufacturing — and eventually pursue the path toward becoming an astronaut.

I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments where curiosity, iteration, and problem-solving are essential. I’m excited to continue growing as an engineer and to contribute to technologies that push the boundaries of flight and exploration!
